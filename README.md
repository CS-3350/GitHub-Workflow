### **The Good about Apache 2.0 license..**
  Apache 2.0 is a permissive license, meaning there are few restrictions on the use of the code. The Apache License 2.0 includes a patent grant clause, which provides users with protection against potential patent claims related to the licensed software. 


### **The Bad about Apache 2.0 license...**
  Any "non-standard" license runs the risk of walling your work off from the wider world. While the Apache License 2.0 includes a patent grant, it does not provide explicit protection against patent claims from other parties. This may expose users to potential patent disputes, especially if the licensed software incorporates patented technologies.
